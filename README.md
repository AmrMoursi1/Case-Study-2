# Case study-2 
## Machine learning-based fault diagnosis for improving mechanical transmission Systems Reliability 'Gearboxes vibration data' 
This research proposes a machine learning-based approach for gearbox fault diagnosis in mechanical transmission systems using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a sliding window method. 
The CNN-based approach achieved 90% accuracy on both the test and train datasets, outperforming other machine learning models such as random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN). 
This approach can potentially enhance the reliability of these systems and prevent catastrophic failures, which can result in costly downtime and repairs.
